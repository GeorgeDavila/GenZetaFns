Generalizations of the Riemann Zeta Function, written Fall of 2015

This repository includes codes for Zeta and some generalizations of Zeta functions. These are of interest in mathematics and mathematical physics. This repository is intended to provide an outline for the numerical analysis of such funtions. 

Due to the very nature of the explored functions and discussed applications, i.e. the use of complex numbers, these mumerical methods may not always be appropriate. Use appropraite caution. 

A more detailed explanation of concepts and applications can be found in the document ZetaPaper.pdf

For a brief description of each code see the document ProgramDescriptions.pdf
